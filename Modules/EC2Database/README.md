# Module EC2Database: template to create an EC2 database server instance.


It consists of four files: 

| File                | Description                          |
| :---                | ---:                                 |
| main.tf             | declaration of the ressource created |
| variables.tf        | input variables and default values   |
| outputs.tf          | output variables                     |
| user-data-db-ec2.sh | user data script with bash instructions to be executed when EC2 instance is created |

Example of usage in your root module with default configuration:
```sh
module "EC2Database" {
  source = "./Modules/EC2Database"
  ec2SubNt = # provide here subnet id
  secGrpID = # provide here the security group id
}
```
## variables.tf

The following variables are mandatory:
* ec2SubNt (string) -- The id of the subnet inside the VPC where the instance is created (must exist).
* secGrpID (string) -- The id of the security group of the EC2 instance created (must exist).

The following variables are optional. If given, new values will override default ones:
*   amiType (string) -- The ID corresponding to the Amazon Machine Image type (default is Amazon Linux 2).
*   insType (string) -- The type of hardware of the EC2 instance (default is t2.micro which is <<free>>).
*   pathToUD (string) -- The path to the folder where the user data script is. Default is relative to folderÂ´s module.
*   publicIP (logical) -- Whether the instance will have a public IP address automatically generated. Default: ```true ```.
*   keyName (string) -- The name of the key pair used to ssh access the EC2 instance. Default is my personal key.


## outputs.tf

The following outputs can be used in root module:
* insID (string) -- The instance ID
* insPublicIP (string) -- The instance public IP address
* insPublicDNS (string) -- The instance public DNS address
* insState (string) -- The instance state (```pending, running, shutting-down, terminated, stopping, stopped```)

Refer to them in your root module as follows
```sh
module.EC2Database.output_variable
```
## user-data-db-ec2.sh

This is a bash shell script that updates the Amazon Linux OS and performs the following actions:
* Installation of mySQL server 8
* Enables mySQL service
* Configures the environment to print out useful information after bash login

## Post creation steps:
ssh into the EC2 instance and
1. Finish mySQL server installation.
1.1. Allow remote connections to mySQL server from desired IPs.
1.2. Check that it is listening through port 3306.
2. restart mySQL service.
3. Create a database and a remote user.
4. restart mySQL service.
